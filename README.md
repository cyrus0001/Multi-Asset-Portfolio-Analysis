##Data Acquisition: Use the yfinance library to download historical prices for your chosen assets (stocks, ETFs, crypto, etc.) over the past 10 years. For example, yfinance’s download() function can fetch data for multiple tickers in one call
pypi.org
. Make sure to request both the adjusted close (Adj Close) and unadjusted close (Close) prices. (The yfinance PyPI page notes that it provides an easy way to fetch Yahoo Finance data
pypi.org
.) You’ll need to decide on ticker symbols and date ranges.
Data Cleaning: Once you have the raw data, handle any missing values. For small gaps (a few days of missing data), you can use interpolation (e.g. DataFrame.interpolate()) or forward-fill (e.g. DataFrame.fillna(method='ffill')). For longer gaps, it may be better to drop those dates or assets. Since Yahoo’s “Adj Close” is already adjusted for splits and dividends, it’s usually sufficient for returns calculations, but double-check if any additional corporate action adjustments are needed. In practice, Pandas functions like interpolate() and fillna() are commonly used to manage missing time-series data.
Portfolio Construction: Choose portfolio weights for your assets that sum to 1 (for example, equal weights or any custom allocation). Compute daily returns using the adjusted close prices: typically

 −1. Then compute the weighted portfolio return each day as the weighted sum of individual asset returns. If you assume a constant-weight portfolio, you simply apply the fixed weights to daily returns. If you consider rebalancing, you would periodically reset the weights to your targets, but initially you can analyze without rebalancing to simplify.
Performance Metrics: Calculate the standard portfolio metrics:
Cumulative Return: The total return over the entire period, e.g. 
(
final portfolio value
/
initial value
)
−
1
(final portfolio value/initial value)−1.
Annualized Return: Often computed as the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), which is the geometric mean growth rate of the portfolio. In finance, CAGR is defined as 
(

𝑉

.
Annualized Volatility: Typically the standard deviation of daily returns, scaled by 
252

​
  (trading days per year).
Sharpe Ratio: A measure of risk-adjusted return. It is defined as the portfolio’s excess return (over a risk-free rate) divided by the return volatility
investopedia.com
. Investopedia explains that the Sharpe ratio “divides a portfolio’s excess returns by a measure of its volatility to assess risk-adjusted performance”
investopedia.com
. For the risk-free rate, you can use a constant like 0.5% annually (approximate 3-month T-bill yield).
Max Drawdown: The maximum peak-to-trough decline of the portfolio value. In other words, the largest percentage drop from a high point to the subsequent low. By definition, “a drawdown is the peak-to-trough decline of an investment… quoted as the percentage difference between the peak and the following trough”
investopedia.com
. The maximum drawdown is simply the worst such decline over the period.
Drawdown Duration: The time it takes to recover from a trough back to the previous peak. You can compute drawdowns over time and record how long each drawdown lasts.
Correlation Analysis: To assess diversification, compute the correlation matrix of asset returns. A correlation of +1 means two assets move perfectly together, -1 means perfectly opposite, and 0 means uncorrelated
investopedia.com
. As Investopedia notes, “diversification works best when assets are uncorrelated or negatively correlated with one another”
investopedia.com
. You can visualize the matrix as a heatmap using seaborn or matplotlib. For rolling correlations, pick asset pairs (e.g. stock vs bond) and compute a 60-day rolling window correlation of their returns, then plot that series to see how correlation changes over time. A correlation matrix “makes the task of choosing different assets easier by presenting their correlation with each other in a tabular form”
investopedia.com
, which helps identify diversification benefits.
Visualization: Common plots include:
Cumulative Return Plot: Plot the growth of a $1 investment (or portfolio value) over time to show cumulative performance.
Correlation Heatmap: A color-coded matrix of the asset return correlations.
Rolling Volatility: Calculate a rolling standard deviation (e.g. 30-day) of portfolio returns and plot it to show how risk changes over time.
Drawdown Curve: Plot the portfolio value or equity curve along with highlight of drawdown periods to visualize maximum drawdowns. (Investopedia’s drawdown article discusses how to interpret drawdown graphs
investopedia.com
.)
Optimization (Optional): For mean-variance optimization, you could use libraries like SciPy or cvxopt (or specialized ones like PyPortfolioOpt). The goal might be to find weights that maximize the Sharpe ratio or minimize volatility given an expected return. This involves solving a constrained optimization problem (e.g. maximize (return - rf)/vol or minimize

 =1). You can compare the optimized portfolio’s metrics (Sharpe, return, volatility) against your original weights to see if the optimizer improved the risk-adjusted return.
